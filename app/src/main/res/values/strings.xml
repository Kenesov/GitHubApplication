    <string name="nested_scroll_text">Tutorialwing.com presents tutorial on NestedScrollView!
        NestedScrollView is just like ScrollView, but it supports acting as both a nested
        scrolling parent and child on both new and old versions of Android. Nested scrolling
        is enabled by default. NestedScrollView is used when there is need for scrolling inside
        another scrolling view. Normally this would be difficult task because system would be
        unable to decide which view to scroll. This is where NestedScrollView comes into role.
